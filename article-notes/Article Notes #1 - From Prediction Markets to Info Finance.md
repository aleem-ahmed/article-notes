## Vitalik's Observation

"From Prediction Markets to Info Finance" is an insightful article where Vitalik explores how betting platforms can extend beyond their traditional role of prediction and speculation on outcomes of events. He argues that these markets could potentially provide critical data for info-finance. He continues to illustrate his point with the example of how betting markets responded to a specific global event: the Venezuelan election.

Vitalik explains that in such elections, odds typically favor Maduro, whom he describes as "almost a dictator." However, he observes something unusual in the latest bets-the odds are skewed. Instead of Maduro dominating the predictions, a notable 23% probability is placed on an alternative candidate. Why is this happening? Vitalik offers the following explanation:

"Of course, we know the unfortunate result of this situation. Ultimately, Maduro did stay in power. However, the markets clued me in to the fact that this time, the attempt to unseat Maduro was serious. There were huge protests, and the opposition played a surprisingly well-executed strategy to prove to the world just how fraudulent the elections were. Had I not received the initial signal from Polymarket that "this time, there is something to pay attention to", I would not have even started paying that much attention."

Vitalik explains that if the odds had aligned with expectations, he wouldnâ€™t have given the situation much thought. However, the discrepancy caught his attention, prompting him to investigate what was happening behind the scenes. He discovered that Venezuelans were independently collecting data on actual election results rather than relying on the officially reported outcomes. Their efforts aimed to pressure the government into acknowledging the true state of affairs.

Vitalik concludes that platforms like Polymarket are not just for betting; they serve as tools for info-finance, catering to two distinct groups:

1. Betters (or gamblers): Those who gamble and risk capital on event outcomes.
2. Observers: Individuals who analyze raw betting data to enhance their understanding of events.

## Info-Finance

Vitalik believes that predicting elections is just the start for platforms like Polymarket. Info-finance solves trust problems. Sources of information are often biased so having a platform for betting on outcomes provides an incentivized way of getting more accurate polling.

"The broader concept is that you can use finance as a way to align incentives in order to provide viewers with valuable information."

Vitalik suggests that prediction markets are "correct by construction," meaning they are deliberately designed to elicit accurate information by aligning incentives. The process begins by defining the specific fact or outcome you want to know, and then creating a market to extract that information.

He provides two examples:

1. Prediction Markets: These markets are used to predict the outcome of an event. For example, you might create a market where participants bet on the winner of an election. The market's prices reflect the collective belief about the likelihood of each outcome.
2. Decision Markets: These are designed to evaluate the potential outcomes of different decisions. For instance, if you want to understand the impact of electing a particular CEO on a company's share price, you can create conditional markets:

	- Market (i): Bet on which decision will be made (e.g., which CEO is chosen).
  	- Market (ii): Bet on the share price if CEO Candidate A is chosen, otherwise zero.
	- Market (iii): Bet on the share price if CEO Candidate B is chosen, otherwise zero.

By analyzing these markets, you can infer which decision the market predicts will lead to a better outcome based on the specified metric (e.g., share price).

The value in this approach is that it can be used for decision-making going forward. We now have a centralized place to refer to when reviewing previous decisions, which can help us learn from mistakes or repeat successes. Regardless, having a permanent record stored somewhere is essential. I personally believe this could be great for democracy, as democracies rely on people being aware of history and previous mistakes in order to learn from them.

Another field that Vitalik believes will be significantly impacted is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Prediction markets focus on what he calls "micro questions"-millions of questions with low consequences. In practice, however, low volume in this type of market often doesn't work efficiently. But with AI, this changes significantly. We can now obtain sufficiently accurate information with only around ~$10 worth of volume.

## Info Finance for Distilled Human Judgement

### Understand the Title

"Distilled" here means simplified or extracted in a more efficient, concentrated form-like distilling liquid to extract the essence. It implies taking the wisdom or judgment of humans (often costly and slow to obtain) and creating a faster, cheaper approximation of it.

### Use in Governance

Another application that Vitalik predicts is using the "Decision Markets" for tracking replicable decision making. Here is how it goes:

1. Create a Prediction Market for Every Decision:
	- For each decision, set up a market where participants can bet on what the outcome of the costly mechanism would be if it were invoked.
	- This is like a more informed and incentive-aligned version of voting. Instead of passively casting a vote, participants have to carefully evaluate the situation because they risk losing their stake if they predict incorrectly.

2. Subsidize the market - To encourage participation and ensure liquidity, add a small amount of money to the market to subsidize bets and incentivize market-making (the process of matching buyers and sellers in the market).

3. Only rarely invoke the costly mechanism:
	- 99.99% of the time, the costly mechanism is not called, and participants' stakes may be refunded, or the market's prediction may be directly used to make the decision.
	- 0.01% of the time, the costly mechanism is invoked to determine the actual outcome. This ensures accuracy and alignment: participants are rewarded based on how well they predicted the costly mechanism's outcome, encouraging truthful and informed betting over time.
	- NOTE - Why is invoking the costly mechanism so rare: it's not just about saving costs but also about ensuring that participants treat every decision as if it might be validated. This keeps them honest and incentivized to predict accurately.

This system leverages the wisdom of the crowd by using financial incentives to more accurately make decisions.

### Usage in DAOs

This can also be used for DAOs. One of the current issues with DAOs is how many decisions need to be made to get anything done. This can be too much for DAO members and results in most people to not be willing to participate in these decision makings. This results in widespread use of delegation which risk centralization of the DAO. Leveraging Prediction Markets to make decisions could work well. 

They key is to balance market and non-market decisions. ALL decisions should NOT be based on these markets.

### My Personal Thoughts

I believe we are going to witness a convergence of DAOs, AIs, and Prediction Markets. AI agents are a powerful tool for handling tasks that would be too costly to use a real human being for. In my opinion, DAOs will definitely leverage them at some point. Since Vitalik predicts that these Prediction Markets will "supercharge" AI, we are going to see all 3 of these field leverage one another.

## Other Uses

1. Personal tokens - platforms like friend.tech will allow these types of markets to better speculate on actions taken by people

2. Advertising - Advertisers could leverage these markets to tell a better data driven narrative for consumers to purchase a product or service

3. Scientific Peer Review - Remove replications in research. Before testing something, check that it hasn't already been done on Prediction Markets.

4. Public Goods Funding - More accurately track who (and how much) was contributed to a public good. This helps us quantify impact of donations by dollar amount.

## Conclusion

Vitaliks article highlights some great uses for prediction markets and how they can impact decision making for individuals. He points out how these markets can help people consume news better and help organizations like DAOs make decisions faster resulting in cost savings.

I look forward to seeing Prediction Markets influence the world in making more data-driven decisions!
