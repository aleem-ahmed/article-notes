"From Prediction Markets to Info Finance" is an insightful article where Vitalik explores how prediction markets can extend beyond their traditional role of gambling on global outcomes. He argues that these markets provide critical data for info-finance, illustrating his point with the example of how betting markets responded to a specific global event: the Venezuelan election.

Vitalik explains that in such elections, odds typically favor Maduro, whom he describes as "almost a dictator." However, he observes something unusual in the latest betsâ€”the odds are skewed. Instead of Maduro dominating the predictions, a notable 23% probability is placed on an alternative candidate. Why is this happening? Vitalik offers the following explanation:

"Of course, we know the unfortunate result of this situation. Ultimately, Maduro did stay in power. However, the markets clued me in to the fact that this time, the attempt to unseat Maduro was serious. There were huge protests, and the opposition played a surprisingly well-executed strategy to prove to the world just how fraudulent the elections were. Had I not received the initial signal from Polymarket that "this time, there is something to pay attention to", I would not have even started paying that much attention."
