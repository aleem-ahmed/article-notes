## Vitalik's Observation

"From Prediction Markets to Info Finance" is an insightful article where Vitalik explores how betting platforms can extend beyond their traditional role of prediction and speculation on outcomes of events. He argues that these markets could potentially provide critical data for info-finance. He continues to illustrate his point with the example of how betting markets responded to a specific global event: the Venezuelan election.

Vitalik explains that in such elections, odds typically favor Maduro, whom he describes as "almost a dictator." However, he observes something unusual in the latest bets—the odds are skewed. Instead of Maduro dominating the predictions, a notable 23% probability is placed on an alternative candidate. Why is this happening? Vitalik offers the following explanation:

"Of course, we know the unfortunate result of this situation. Ultimately, Maduro did stay in power. However, the markets clued me in to the fact that this time, the attempt to unseat Maduro was serious. There were huge protests, and the opposition played a surprisingly well-executed strategy to prove to the world just how fraudulent the elections were. Had I not received the initial signal from Polymarket that "this time, there is something to pay attention to", I would not have even started paying that much attention."

Vitalik explains that if the odds had aligned with expectations, he wouldn’t have given the situation much thought. However, the discrepancy caught his attention, prompting him to investigate what was happening behind the scenes. He discovered that Venezuelans were independently collecting data on actual election results rather than relying on the officially reported outcomes. Their efforts aimed to pressure the government into acknowledging the true state of affairs.

Vitalik concludes that platforms like Polymarket are not just for betting; they serve as tools for info-finance, catering to two distinct groups:

1. Betters (or gamblers): Those who gamble and risk capital on event outcomes.
2. Observers: Individuals who analyze raw betting data to enhance their understanding of events.

## Info-Finance

Vitalik believes that predicting elections is just the start for platforms like Polymarket. Info-finance solves trust problems. Sources of information are often biased so having a platform for betting on outcomes provides an incentivized way of getting more accurate polling.

"The broader concept is that you can use finance as a way to align incentives in order to provide viewers with valuable information."
